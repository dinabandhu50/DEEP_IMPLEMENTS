# DEEP_IMPLEMENTS
This Project is where I Implement popular Deep Neural Network architecture from scratch using pytorch. 
This project is largely designed based on pytorch libraries such as learning the classification architectures which are given on torchvision library only.

## Contents
 - Image data
   - AlexNet
   - VGG16
   - RESNET
   - Inception
 - Sequence data
   - RNN, LSTM, GRU n all
   - Attention
   - Transformers
 
## How to use it
 There are two main folders `src` and `notebooks`. The `notebooks` has jupyter notebooks of implementations and the `src` as python files.  
 - I have implemented first on notebooks then on python files
## Image Data
Image data based networks. CNN based DNN architectures.

### Alexnet:

### VGG16:

### RESNET:

### Inception:

## Sequence Data
Sequence data types.

### RNN, LSTM, GRU n all:

### Attention:

### Transformers:
